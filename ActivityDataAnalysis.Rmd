This is an R Markdown document for my solution to the assignment 1 of course **Reproduciable Research** on Coursera
      
## Loading and preprocessing the data
Let's take a first look of the dataset
```{r read and orginize data}
data_path = "/Users/chenhao/GitProject/RepData_PeerAssessment1/"
activity_data = read.csv(paste(data_path,"activity.csv", sep=""), 
                         stringsAsFactors = F)
# format the data and transform NA to 0
activity_data$date <- as.Date(activity_data$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
#activity_data$steps[is.na(activity_data$steps)] = 0
head(activity_data)
```
         
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
split the data by date and do analysis of steps on date
```{r mean steps analysis}
# organize the date by days
sum_steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity_data, sum)
mean_steps = as.integer(mean(sum_steps_per_day$step, na.rm = T))
median_steps = as.integer(median(sum_steps_per_day$step, na.rm = T))
# plot the histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(sum_steps_per_day$steps, 
     main="Histogram of The Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day",
     xlab = "total number of steps taken per day"
     ) 
```   
        
The mean total number of steps taken per day was `r mean_steps` , and 
The median total number of steps taken per day was `r median_steps`.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
split the data by interval and do analysis of steps on interval
```{r average daily activity pattern}
# organize the data by daily time series
daily_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity_data, mean)
plot(daily_steps$interval, 
     daily_steps$steps,
     type = "l",
     main = "Average Number of Steps Taken Each 5 Minutes Interval",
     xlab = "time interval",
     ylab = "average steps taken")

abline(v = daily_steps[daily_steps$steps == max(daily_steps$steps), 1], 
       col = "red")
text(x = daily_steps[daily_steps$steps == max(daily_steps$steps),1],
     y = max(daily_steps$steps),
     labels= max(daily_steps$steps),
     cex= 0.7, offset = 10)

maximun_activity_pattern  = daily_steps[daily_steps$steps == max(daily_steps$steps),1]
```
       
the **`r maximun_activity_pattern`th** 5-minute interval contains the maximum number of steps on average across all the days in the dataset.

## Imputing missing values
```{r deal with missing value}
# check the number of NA values
NA_num = sum(is.na(activity_data$steps))

# fill the missing values with mean steps of that interval
new_activity_data <- activity_data
for (i in 1:length(new_activity_data$steps)) {
       if (is.na(new_activity_data$steps[i])) {
               mean_activity <- daily_steps[daily_steps$interval == new_activity_data$interval[i], 2]
               new_activity_data$steps[i] <- mean_activity }        
}

# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
new_sum_steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = new_activity_data, sum)
new_mean_steps = as.integer(mean(new_sum_steps_per_day$step, na.rm = T))
new_median_steps = as.integer(median(new_sum_steps_per_day$step, na.rm = T))
# plot the histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(new_sum_steps_per_day$steps, 
     main="Histogram of The Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day with filling of missing values",
     xlab = "total number of steps taken per day"
     ) 
```    
       
After repalcing `r NA_num` missing values with mean activity of that interval,
The mean total number of steps taken per day was `r new_mean_steps` , and 
The median total number of steps taken per day was `r new_median_steps`. So we find that the mean value remain the same while the median increased a little.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Let's split the data by week_label and time interval, then calculate the mean steps for each
combine of weeklabel and time interval, using lattice to give a plot to visually show the answer.
```{r week labelled analysis}
weekdays = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
weekends = c("Saturday", "Sunday")

# add week labels to the dataset
week_label = vector()
new_activity_data$date <- weekdays(new_activity_data$date)
for (i in 1:length(new_activity_data$date)){
        if (new_activity_data$date[i] %in% weekdays){
                week_label = c(week_label, "weekday")  }
        else{
                week_label = c(week_label, "weekend")  }
}
new_activity_data <- transform( new_activity_data, week_labels = week_label)

# split the data by week label and interval then calcualte the mean steps, and plot
mean_steps_per_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + week_labels, 
                                     data = new_activity_data, mean)
library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval|week_labels, 
       data = mean_steps_per_interval,
       type = "l",
       xlab = "Interval",
       ylab = "Number of steps",
       layout=c(1,2))
```
      
We can see that people get more activity on weekends, aha, due to more avaliable time.
